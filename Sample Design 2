Approach: Modular and Configurable Logic with Dynamic SQL

1. YAML Configuration: Abstract Complex Logic
Instead of defining a single-line condition in the YAML file, allow for references to SQL logic files for each rule. These files can encapsulate the required CTEs and logic.

Example YAML File:
yaml
Copy code
control_procedures:
  - cp_id: 100
    name: "Database Backup Hygiene"
    rules:
      - id: "rule_1"
        condition_file: "rule_1_logic.sql"
        failure_code: "no_successful_backup"
      - id: "rule_2"
        condition_file: "rule_2_logic.sql"
        failure_code: "backup_outdated"
      - id: "rule_3"
        condition_file: "rule_3_logic.sql"
        failure_code: "waiver"
Each condition_file will point to a standalone SQL file containing the complex logic.

2. Store Complex Rule Logic in SQL Files
Define each complex rule logic in individual SQL files to keep them modular and maintainable. Use CTEs and ranking as needed.

Example: rule_1_logic.sql
sql
Copy code
WITH ranked_backups AS (
    SELECT
        app_id,
        backup_status,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY app_id ORDER BY last_backup_date DESC) AS backup_rank
    FROM {{ ref('base_db_backups') }}
),
latest_backup AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM ranked_backups
    WHERE backup_rank = 1
)
SELECT
    app_id,
    CASE
        WHEN backup_status != 'successful' THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END AS failure_condition
FROM latest_backup


3. DBT Macro to Dynamically Inject Complex Logic
Write a DBT macro that dynamically executes the complex SQL logic for each rule. The macro should:

Read the rule logic file.
Execute the SQL within the DBT model.
Example Macro:
sql
Copy code
{% macro apply_complex_rule_logic(rule_config) %}
WITH rule_logic AS (
    {{ read_file(rule_config['condition_file']) }}
)
SELECT
    rl.app_id,
    '{{ rule_config["failure_code"] }}' AS failure_code,
    rl.failure_condition
FROM rule_logic rl
WHERE rl.failure_condition = TRUE
{% endmacro %}
The read_file() function can be implemented using DBT's built-in file-reading capabilities or Python if preprocessed outside DBT.

4. DBT Model to Apply All Rules
Create a DBT model that iterates through all rules in the configuration, dynamically applying each complex logic file.

Example DBT Model:
sql
Copy code
{% for rule in var('control_procedure_config')['rules'] %}
    {% set rule_logic = apply_complex_rule_logic(rule) %}
    {% if not loop.first %}
        UNION ALL
    {% endif %}
    {{ rule_logic }}
{% endfor %}
This aggregates the results of all rules dynamically.

5. Aggregating Results
After processing all rules, aggregate the results to classify the overall compliance status (pass or fail) and provide detailed failure reasons.

Example Aggregation SQL:
sql
Copy code
WITH all_rule_results AS (
    {{ apply_all_rules(var('control_procedure_config')) }}
),
final_compliance AS (
    SELECT
        app_id,
        CASE
            WHEN COUNT(failure_code) > 0 THEN 'fail'
            ELSE 'pass'
        END AS compliance_status,
        ARRAY_AGG(failure_code) AS failure_codes
    FROM all_rule_results
    GROUP BY app_id
)
SELECT * FROM final_compliance


6. Automated Testing and Debugging
a) Test for Individual Rule Logic
Write tests to validate each standalone rule logic file (e.g., rule_1_logic.sql) independently.

Ensure the expected failure condition is derived correctly.
b) Test Final Aggregated Output
Write DBT tests to check:

No missing values in failure_code.
All failure_condition = TRUE rows have a corresponding failure_code.
Example DBT test:

yaml
Copy code
tests:
  - name: validate_failure_conditions
    description: Ensure all failures have a valid failure code.
    columns:
      - name: failure_code
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: compliance_status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['pass', 'fail']

7. Dynamic Execution of New Rules
When adding a new CP or rule:

Add a new entry in the YAML file, pointing to the logic file for the new rule.
Create the corresponding SQL file (e.g., rule_4_logic.sql) with the required CTEs and logic.
Run the DBT pipelineâ€”no changes to the core models are needed.


Benefits of This Approach

Modularization: Complex conditions are isolated in separate SQL files, improving maintainability.
Scalability: Adding new CPs or rules only involves updating configuration and creating logic files.
Traceability: Each failure is tied to its specific rule ID and failure code, ensuring clear diagnostics.
Dynamic Execution: Logic is injected dynamically, reducing hardcoding in DBT models.
