1. Design a Configurable and Modular Structure

a) Source Configuration
Define a source.yml file to declare all the source tables required for your CP logic. For example:
yaml
Copy code
sources:
  - name: app_data
    tables:
      - name: db_backups

b) Dynamic CP Configuration
Use a YAML or JSON file to store the logic for different CPs, allowing easy additions or modifications without changing the DBT model code.
Example YAML structure:
yaml
Copy code
control_procedures:
  - cp_id: 100
    name: "Database Backup Hygiene"
    rules:
      - condition: "backup_status = 'successful'"
        failure_code: "no_successful_backup"
      - condition: "last_backup_date < date_sub(current_date, interval 7 day)"
        failure_code: "backup_outdated"
      - condition: "backup_waived = true"
        failure_code: "waiver"

2. Build Generic Models for Reusability

a) Base Model for Source Data
Create a base DBT model that consolidates raw data from the source table:

sql
Copy code
-- models/base_db_backups.sql
SELECT
    app_id,
    backup_status,
    last_backup_date,
    backup_waived,
    CURRENT_DATE AS report_date
FROM {{ source('app_data', 'db_backups') }}

b) Dynamic CP Evaluation Logic
Create a generic DBT model that applies CP rules dynamically by reading from the YAML configuration:
sql
Copy code
-- models/evaluate_cp_logic.sql
WITH base_data AS (
    SELECT * FROM {{ ref('base_db_backups') }}
),
cp_logic AS (
    SELECT
        app_id,
        '{{ config.cp_id }}' AS cp_id,
        CASE
            WHEN {{ config.condition }} THEN '{{ config.failure_code }}'
            ELSE 'pass'
        END AS compliance_status,
        report_date
    FROM base_data
)
SELECT * FROM cp_logic
Use dbt run-operation or macros to dynamically pass the CP logic from the YAML configuration to this model.

c) Master Report Aggregation
Combine all CP results into a single report for compliance monitoring:
sql
Copy code
-- models/master_compliance_report.sql
SELECT
    app_id,
    cp_id,
    compliance_status,
    report_date
FROM {{ ref('evaluate_cp_logic') }}

3. Leverage DBT Macros for Dynamic Logic
Use macros to dynamically interpret and apply the CP conditions defined in the YAML file:

sql
Copy code
-- macros/apply_cp_rules.sql
{% macro apply_cp_rules(cp_config) %}
SELECT
    app_id,
    '{{ cp_config["cp_id"] }}' AS cp_id,
    CASE
        {% for rule in cp_config["rules"] %}
        WHEN {{ rule.condition }} THEN '{{ rule.failure_code }}'
        {% endfor %}
        ELSE 'pass'
    END AS compliance_status
FROM {{ ref('base_db_backups') }}
{% endmacro %}
Call this macro in your DBT model:

sql
Copy code
-- models/evaluate_cp_logic.sql
{{ apply_cp_rules(var('control_procedure_config')) }}

4. Parameterize the CP Logic
Use DBT variables to dynamically pass CP configurations during execution:

Pass the specific CP logic as a DBT variable:
bash
Copy code
dbt run --vars '{"control_procedure_config": {{ read_yaml('control_procedures.yml')["cp_id_100"] }} }'

5. Testing and Documentation

a) DBT Tests
Write tests for specific logic like:
No missing values in the backup_status column.
Validity of last_backup_date.
yaml
Copy code
tests:
  - db_backups:
      - not_null:
          column_name: backup_status
      - accepted_values:
          column_name: backup_status
          values: ['successful', 'failed', 'waived']

b) DBT Documentation
Use DBT docs to generate a clear lineage and description of models and configurations.

6. Scalable Execution

a) Incremental Models
Implement incremental processing for large datasets by filtering on report_date:
sql
Copy code
WHERE report_date = CURRENT_DATE

b) Partitioning and Parallelization
Use partitioning to split models by CP or app for faster execution.

7. Add New CPs Dynamically

Simply update the YAML configuration file with the new CP logic.
No need to modify core DBT models, as they are dynamically driven by the configuration.
This design ensures configurability, modularity, and scalability, reducing the time and effort required to onboard new Control Procedures into your compliance reporting application.
